## Q1 — Five-number Summary {#q1}
The study_hours_by_month.csv dataset consists of recorded study hours (in hours) from individual study sessions across different months of the year.

Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, obtain the five-number summary of the variable study_hours using the summary() function.

What is the median value of study_hours?
```{webr}
study_data <- read.csv("study_hours_by_month.csv")

```

## Q2 — Interquartile Range {#q2}

Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, compute the interquartile range (IQR) of the variable study_hours.

```{webr}

```

## Q3 - Sample standard deviation {#q3}

Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, compute the sample standard deviation of the variable study_hours.

```{webr}

```

## Q4 - Grouped mean by month {#q4}

Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, compute the mean study hours for each month.

What is the mean study hours in April?

Hint: You may find the tapply() function helpful.
```{webr}

```

## Q5 - Boxplot ordered by median {#q5}
Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, create a boxplot of study_hours grouped by month, with the months reordered by the median study hours.

After reordering months by their median study hours, what is the median study hours corresponding to the 3rd smallest median? (Answers within ±0.1 will be considered correct.)

Hint: You may find the reorder() function and geom_boxplot() helpful.
```{webr}
library(ggplot2)

```

## Q6 - Histogram and distribution shape {#q6}
Using the dataset study_hours_by_month.csv, create a histogram of study_hours with approximately 12 bins.

Based on the histogram of study_hours, which best describes the shape of the distribution?
