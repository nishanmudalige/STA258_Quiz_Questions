## Q1 — Five-number Summary {#q1}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year. 

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, obtain the five-number summary of the variable `page_load_time` using the `summary()` function.

What is the maximum value of `page_load_time`?
```{webr}
load_data <- read.csv("load_time.csv")

```

## Q2 — Interquartile Range {#q2}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year. 

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, compute the interquartile range (IQR) of the variable `page_load_time`.

```{webr}

```

## Q3 - Sample Variance {#q3}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year. 

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, compute the sample variance of the variable `page_load_time`.

```{webr}

```

## Q4 - Grouped Summary by Month {#q4}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year.

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, find the maximum load time for each month.

What is the maximum load time on the 9th month (September)?

Hint: You may find the tapply() function helpful.
```{webr}

```

## Q5 - Boxplot Ordered by Mean {#q5}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year.

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, create a boxplot of `page_load_time` grouped by `month`, with the months reordered by the mean load times.

After reordering months by their mean load times, what is the mean load time corresponding to the 5th smallest mean? *(Answers within ±0.1 will be considered correct.)*

Hint: You may find the `reorder()` function and `geom_boxplot()` helpful.
```{webr}

```

## Q6 - Boxplot and Outliers {#q6}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year.

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, create a boxplot of `page_load_time` grouped by `month`.

Which month has the highest maximum page load time?

```{webr}

```

## Q7 - Histogram and Distribution Shape {#q7}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year.

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, create a histogram of `page_load_time` with approximately 12 bins.

Based on the histogram of `page_load_time`, which best describes the shape of the distribution?

```{webr}

```

## Q8 - Scatterplot {#q8}

The `load_time.csv` dataset consists of the monthly average website page load times (in milliseconds) over a year.

Using the dataset `load_time.csv`, build a scatterplot of mapping `month_num` as x and `page_load_time` as y.

Which of the following best describes the relationship between `month_num` and `page_load_time`?
```{webr}
load_data <- read.csv("load_time.csv")
# Fill in the blanks
ggplot(___, aes(___, ___)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Page Load Time by Month",
       x = "Month Number",
       y = "Page Load Time")

```
